# Our plan for working together

## Vibes lead

The vibes leader for the day will be the person who is tasked with being attentive to the synergy and group dynamics for the day as well as other tasks including:

- Rounding everyone up for meetings (flicking an @ in the chat)
- Lead fun activity either during morning accountability group or during afternoon (default activity is doing the stuff quiz)
- Checking in and asking members 1 on 1 during the day how they are feeling
- Lead group retro

## Conflict management plan

- Take 5 to cool off before attempting to sort things out
- Take time to try to understand and acknowledge the issue from the other person's point of view
- Take care with phrasing, approach with empathy, try to explain your feelings without causing the other person to be defensive

- Establish who cares/has an opinion or view on the issue
- Give those members a minute to say their piece/side/view so everyone can be heard and understood
- If no agreement reached, put it to a vote

- Go to agile/vibes lead and all parties involved can try to resolve things
- If needed, escalate it to a group discussion (try to avoid this if possible)

- Reminder of separation of concerns - who is actually responsible for said thing?

## Wellbeing plan

### How we are going to take care of ourselves

What things are you going to do for your wellbeing during this project? You might want to think about physical wellbeing, relationships/family, mental and emotional wellbeing, environmental aspects.

Will be individual for each member, think back to our human skills session on wellbeing.

- Jasmine - Planned mindfulness in the afternoons, mandatory screen break during lunch, will eat lunch outside if possible, journalling each day

- Matt - Take small breaks often throughout the day, Make sure to take a lunch break & drink water. Go for a walk or some sort of exercise

- Maria - Taking breaks regularly, doing yoga, going out when I can, spending quality time with family

- Garrett - Taking breaks often, Time away from screen, Making sure I get a good amount of sleep

- Jesse - Taking a break after the closing circle to spend time with partner and eat dinner with her, Making sure I tak a walk each day and get outside

### How we are going to take care of each other

Being aware of what stress looks like for the other team members (see miro), being vigilant to the signs.

Responding to those signs with what we have said would help us in those times of stress (see miro). Commonly people would like to be asked what their needs are, so they can let us know how we can best help them.

Asking each other questions such as "when did you last take a break?", "have you eaten something/had lunch?".
